    <h1>My Turing Mod 1 Experience</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I very much enjoyed the first Mod at Turing. I really learned alot about
    Ruby programming language and was able to work on some cool projects.
    My favorite technical concept was the idea of recursion. Recursion in Ruby
    is when a method calls on itself in a loop until some parameters are
    met.</p>
